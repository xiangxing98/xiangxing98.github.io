# data-visualisation

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

# data
# mpg
ggplot2::mpg


ggplot(data = ggplot2::mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
# displ, a car’s engine size, in litres.
# hwy, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). 
# A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.

```


```{r}

ggplot(data = ggplot2::mpg) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# A graphing template
# ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  # <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```


## 3.2.4 Exercises

Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
# blank
```

How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?
```{r}
ggplot2::mpg
# A tibble: 234 x 11
dim(ggplot2::mpg)
# [1] 234  11

```


What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.
```{r}
?ggplot2::mpg
# Fuel economy data from 1999 and 2008 for 38 popular models of car

```

### ggplot2::mpg Format

A data frame with 234 rows and 11 variables

manufacturer
model
model name

displ
engine displacement, in litres

year
year of manufacture

cyl
number of cylinders

trans
type of transmission

drv
f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd

cty
city miles per gallon

hwy
highway miles per gallon

fl
fuel type

class
"type" of car

Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

```{r}
ggplot(data = ggplot2::mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl, color = class))


ggplot(data = ggplot2::mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```


What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
